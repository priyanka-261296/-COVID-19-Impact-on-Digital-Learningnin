Data Description
We have provided a set of daily edtech engagement data from over 200 school districts in 2020, and we encourage you to leverage other publicly available data sources in your analysis. We include three basic sets of files to help you get started:

The engagement_ data folder is based on LearnPlatform’s Student Chrome Extension. The extension collects page load events of over 10K education technology products in our product library, including websites, apps, web apps, software programs, extensions, ebooks, hardwares, and services used in educational institutions. The engagement data have been aggregated at school district level, and each file represents data from one school district.
The products_info.csv file includes information about the characteristics of the top 372 products with most users in 2020.
The districts_info.csv file includes information about the characteristics of school districts, including data from NCES and FCC.
The definitions of each column in the three data sets are detailed in the README file.
In addition to the files provided, we encourage you to use other public data sources such as COVID-19 US State Policy database, KIDS Count, and KFF.
